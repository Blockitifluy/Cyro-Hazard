## Description

Cyro Hazard takes place on a polluted Texas, infected with zombies; some regular, some morbid mutated abombinations. Playing as:

- A burn victim ex-firefighter
- An insane micro-biologist, only concerned about herself
- And a corrupt banker

Starting from the scraps of this apocalyptic world will you escape?
